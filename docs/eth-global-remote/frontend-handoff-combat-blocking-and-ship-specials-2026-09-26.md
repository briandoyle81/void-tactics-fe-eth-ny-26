# Frontend Handoff: Enemy-Blocking Combat & Ship Special-Slot Validation

**Written: 2026-09-26.** Everything that changed in the contracts since `docs/frontend-handoff-maps-and-deployment-zones-2026-09-23.md` (including its 2026-09-25 amendment — still the source of truth for maps/impassable-terrain/deployment-zones/map-names; nothing here supersedes it). Describes the contracts **on `main` in the working tree**; only §3 below is actually live anywhere — everything else is not yet deployed. Re-verify against the contracts if they have changed since this date.

Companion docs: `docs/frontend-handoff-maps-and-deployment-zones-2026-09-23.md` (maps/zones/impassable terrain, unaffected by this doc), `docs/frontend-handoff-attributes-costs-and-ai-2026-09-21.md` (attributes/costs/AI trees, unaffected), `docs/ai-ship-configs.md` (unaffected).

## 0. TL;DR — what to do

1. **Regenerate ABIs** for `Game`, `IGameView`, `Maps`, `IMaps`, `DroneYard`, `GenerateNewShip` — all additive this round (new functions/errors), **no existing function signatures changed**.
2. **New gameplay rule: enemy ships now block movement and line of sight**, not just terrain (§1). `moveShip` can revert the same `InvalidMove()` you already handle, for a new reason.
3. **`DroneYard.modifyShip` has a new revert reason**: `InvalidSpecial(Special)` (§2) — thrown if a player tries to equip a special slot that does nothing for their ship's faction.
4. **Ship generation no longer produces dead specials** (§2) — every newly-minted ship's special, if any, is guaranteed to actually do something.
5. **Already live, no redeploy needed**: free-ship and tutorial-ship claims no longer require passing eligibility verification (§3) — a direct state change against the currently-deployed contracts, not a code change.
6. Everything in §1 and §2 is **not yet deployed** — still pending the next full redeploy, same status as the `updatePresetMapImpassable` fix noted in the prior doc's 2026-09-25 amendment.

## 1. Enemy ships now block movement and line of sight

### 1.1 The concept

Previously, only terrain mattered for blocking: `impassable` tiles blocked movement, `blocked` tiles blocked line of sight (see the 2026-09-23 doc). Ships themselves only ever blocked **landing directly on their own tile** — a ship could always fly past or shoot through another ship standing in the way.

That's now split by side:
- **Ally ships**: unchanged. Still only block landing on their exact tile; never block movement-through or line of sight.
- **Enemy ships**: now a hard obstacle, like a wall. They block landing on their tile (already true), **and now also block movement passing through their tile, and line of sight shooting through their tile.**

### 1.2 How it's enforced (mostly internal, know this exists)

Two new `Maps.sol` / `IMaps.sol` functions:
```solidity
function hasMovementPathAvoidingShips(uint _gameId, int16 _row0, int16 _col0, int16 _row1, int16 _col1, uint256 _enemyOccupiedBitmap) external view returns (bool)
function hasMapsAvoidingShips(uint _gameId, int16 _row0, int16 _col0, int16 _row1, int16 _col1, uint256 _enemyOccupiedBitmap) external view returns (bool)
```
These are the existing `hasMovementPath`/`hasMaps` straight-line (Bresenham) checks, plus a caller-supplied bitmap of enemy ship tiles OR'd into the blocking mask. `Game.sol` builds this bitmap from live ship positions and calls these automatically inside `moveShip` — **the FE doesn't need to call these directly**, the same way it never needed to call `hasMovementPath`/`hasMaps` directly. They're mentioned here only because they're new public ABI surface, and because if the FE ever builds its own client-side "can I move/shoot here" preview (rather than just trying the move and handling a revert), that preview now needs to account for enemy-ship blocking too, not just terrain, to match on-chain behavior.

### 1.3 Gameplay impact

- `moveShip` can now revert `InvalidMove()` because an enemy ship sits somewhere on the straight-line path — not just because of impassable terrain. **Same error, no new error type** — if the FE already treats `InvalidMove()` generically ("that move isn't legal"), no code change is required. If the FE has specific user-facing copy like "blocked by terrain," it's no longer fully accurate and may want to generalize to "blocked" or "path obstructed."
- Same rule applies to shooting: a `Shoot`/`Special` action at range > 1 already required clear line of sight; now that check also fails if a *different* enemy ship sits between the shooter and the target. You can always shoot the enemy actually standing at the target tile — only other enemies *along the way* can block the shot.
- No change to `ActionType`, targeting parameters, or any existing revert reason's meaning — this is a pure behavior tightening under the same `InvalidMove()`.

### 1.4 AI behavior

Single-player/roguelike AI (`AIBehavior.sol`, `Variant1AI.sol`) was updated to route around a blocking enemy and consider alternate approach tiles when its direct path is obstructed, rather than blindly attempting an illegal move and falling back to `Pass` (which is what would otherwise happen — `SinglePlayerMatch`/`RoguelikeMatch` already wrap AI moves in try/catch). Net effect: AI should be equal-or-better at reaching its objectives around clustered ships than before, not worse — but exact AI paths/timing around enemy clusters may differ slightly from what you've seen previously.

## 2. Ship special-slot validation — no more dead specials

### 2.1 Background

Each faction (`traits.variant`) has 8 possible "special" slots (`Special` enum, 0 = None, 1–7). Today, only slots 1–3 do anything for either faction (variant 1: EMP/RepairDrones/FlakArray; variant 2: ElectricStorm/DroneSwarm/AdditionalThruster). Slots 4–7 are unused filler reserved for future content.

Previously, nothing prevented a ship from ending up equipped with one of those unused slots:
- Ship generation (`GenerateNewShip.sol`) rolled a special uniformly across all 8 values, regardless of variant.
- `DroneYard.modifyShip` let a player equip any of the 8 values freely, with no validation at all.

A ship in this state looks completely normal until its Special action is actually used — at which point `moveShip` reverts `InvalidMove()` immediately, before any targeting/range logic even runs, because there's no effect resolver wired up for that (variant, slot) pair. This is exactly the shape of a live issue that was reported and traced back to this gap.

### 2.2 The fix

- **`Game.sol`** gained a per-variant "how many real slots does this faction have" value:
  ```solidity
  mapping(uint16 => uint8) public maxSpecialSlot;
  function setMaxSpecialSlot(uint16 _variant, Special _slot) external onlyOwner;
  ```
  Owner/admin-config only (set once per variant at deploy time, currently `3` for both factions) — not something the FE calls, but `maxSpecialSlot(variant)` is a public getter the FE can read.
- **`GenerateNewShip.sol`**: the random special roll is now constrained to `0..maxSpecialSlot[variant]` instead of `0..7` — a freshly-generated ship can never land on a dead slot.
- **`DroneYard.sol`** (`modifyShip`) has a new revert:
  ```solidity
  error InvalidSpecial(Special _special);
  ```
  Thrown if a player tries to equip a slot beyond `maxSpecialSlot[variant]` for their ship's faction.

### 2.3 What this does *not* cover

- **`Ships.sol`'s own `customizeShip`/`createSpecificShip`** (used by other authorized minting flows — event ships, prize ships, etc. — not the general player-facing DroneYard customization flow) still has **zero** special-slot validation, for the same reason its `traits.variant` bound is also unchecked there: `Ships.sol` has essentially no bytecode headroom left for another check. Any backend/authorized-caller code building a `Ship` struct for one of these calls is responsible for staying within `0..maxSpecialSlot[variant]` itself.
- **Already-minted ships** carrying a dead special from before this fix (including the one that prompted it) are **not retroactively repaired**. This only prevents new dead-special ships going forward, once deployed.

## 3. Already live: free/tutorial ship claim verification disabled

Against the **currently-deployed** Base Sepolia contracts (the 2026-09-23 deploy) — no code change, no redeploy:
```
FreeShipClaim.setEligibilityProvider(address(0))
TutorialClaim.setEligibilityProvider(address(0))
```
Both calls have already been made and confirmed. Claiming a free ship or a tutorial ship no longer requires passing whatever eligibility/verification check was previously gated behind the eligibility provider. If the FE has an "ineligible" rejection or verification-prompt flow specifically for these two claims, it should no longer trigger — confirm against the live contract if you were relying on that path.

## 4. Frontend checklist

- [ ] Regenerate ABIs: `Game`, `IGameView`, `Maps`, `IMaps`, `DroneYard`, `GenerateNewShip` — all additive, no existing signatures changed.
- [ ] Handle the new `DroneYard.InvalidSpecial(Special)` revert reason in ship customization UI, alongside the existing `ArmorAndShieldsBothSet`/`InvalidVariant`/etc.
- [ ] Ship customization "special" picker: cap offered options at `Game.maxSpecialSlot(variant)` (new public getter) instead of the raw 0–7 enum range — anything above it will always revert.
- [ ] Combat/movement UI: `InvalidMove()` can now also mean "an enemy ship is blocking this path or line of sight," not just terrain. No code change required if `InvalidMove()` is already handled generically; update any specific "blocked by terrain" copy if you have it.
- [ ] Free/tutorial ship claim UI: confirm whether you had an eligibility-check flow for these — it's no longer needed against the live contract (§3, already in effect).
- [ ] Nothing in §1/§2 is deployed yet — treat as "coming in the next full redeploy," same status as the impassable-tile-update fix from the prior doc's 2026-09-25 amendment. §3 is the only change here that's already live.

## 5. Not changed / out of scope

- Maps, deployment zones, impassable terrain, map names — unchanged since the 2026-09-23 doc and its 2026-09-25 amendment; that doc is still current for all of it.
- Attributes, costs, variant balance numbers — unchanged since 2026-09-21.
- `Ships.sol` — untouched (see §2.3 for the one caveat that follows from that).
- `ActionType`, targeting parameters, and every other existing revert reason's meaning — unchanged.
- Full test suite: 804 passing (was 778 as of the 2026-09-23 doc) — growth from new test coverage added alongside this work, not from new game content.
